**Today's Progress:** Chat App Client/Server: Added Forgot / Reset password functionality. Learnt to send mail from node.js backend using nodemailer.

### Day 18: 15 Feb 2020

**Today's Progress:** Chat App Server: Added Rate Limiter middleware to prevent timing attacks.
The Password Reset Token has been hashed prior to saving it in the DB, so it doesnâ€™t compromise user account even if the DB is attacked (e.g., hacker gaining read access to the DB and see plain-text tokens is a threat!)
Removed the pseudorandom number generator Math.random() and replaced it with the cryptographically secure random number generator crypto.randomBytes() function. Math.random() is predictable and a hacker can generate numbers to determine what would be generated next. Crypto.randomBytes() uses system entropy to generate numbers, and is used by OpenSSL!

**Thoughts:** Added security features to the app, making it more secure against attacks!

### Day 19: 16 Feb 2020

### Day 22: 19 Feb 2020

**Today's Progress:** Had to refactor the code completely to handle word pairs matching.
