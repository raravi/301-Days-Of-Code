# #301DaysOfCode - Log
The daily log of my **#301DaysOfCode** challenge.

## Log

### Day 1: 27 Jan 2020

**Today's Progress:** Trying out firebase with a React app. Created a React app. Then created a firebase DB. And connected the two for now. Using the freeCodeCamp React exercise for Todoist clone.

**Thoughts:** The going is slow. But there are many concepts to grasp. React hooks, firebase, Sass mixins.

**Link to work:** No link yet, I have to create a repo and safeguard the API keys before that!

### Day 2: 28 Jan 2020

**Today's Progress:** Todoist clone: firebase API key has been obfuscated, and the repo set up for project. Sudoku: Working on Sudoku game in React. Setting up the static version of the site.

**Thoughts:** Good progress today. Satisfied.

### Day 3: 29 Jan 2020

**Today's Progress:** Sudoku: Added Status buttons. Made the static version of the site responsive!

### Day 4: 30 Jan 2020

**Today's Progress:** Sudoku: Moved the code into different components. Added Timer functionality using [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) and useEffect hook. Used the map() function to keep the code DRY.

**Thoughts:** moment.js took most of my time today.
